# Using Synthetic Data to Improve Paraphrase Identification
We propose to use data augmentation for the task of paraphrase identification by creating new paraphrase pairs with the help of a paraphrase database. We analyse the effect of the amount of synthetic data that is added to the original training data. Additionally, we discuss different strategies for selecting a subset of the generated data to train on and compare these strategies on the "Quora Question Pair" data set. Finally, we propose a "batch-wise selection" approach that allows selecting the synthetic data during training based on where the model struggles the most. We also provide an in-depth analysis of our experiments.	- copied from our interim report abstract-
